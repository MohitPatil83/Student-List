# Django Student Management System

This project is a basic web application built using Django, which helps users manage student information. The system has functionality for users to register, log in, and handle student details. Each logged-in user can add, edit, view, and delete students. The app ensures that users only see their own student data.

### Main Features:
1. **User Registration and Login**: 
   - Users can create an account by registering with a username and password.
   - Once registered, they can log in and access the student management features.
   
2. **CRUD Operations for Students**:
   - **Add a Student**: Users can input a student’s name, class, division, and roll number.
   - **View Student List**: After adding a student, they appear in a list that only the logged-in user can see.
   - **Edit Student Details**: Users can update the information of any student they added.
   - **Delete a Student**: If needed, a student record can be removed from the list.

3. **Session Management**:
   - Users must be logged in to manage student data.
   - Each user can only see and manage their own students, ensuring data privacy.

### Design and Style:
The project uses Bootstrap for styling, providing a simple and clean user interface with a light blue theme. The layout is responsive, making it user-friendly on different devices.

### Database:
The student information and user data are stored in a MySQL or MariaDB database. This ensures that each user’s data is secure and only accessible to them.

In summary, this project demonstrates how to use Django for user authentication and to perform basic CRUD operations, all within a simple and secure web application.
